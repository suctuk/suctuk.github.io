                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Someone close to me told me that most Gen Z kids likely won't be able to afford houses by their 30s.
                    I don't know if this is true, but it for sure has me thinking that if we cannot move through western
                    life checking the same boxes that we see in our movies, or follow the same patterns our parents did,
                    what is the point of working for it then? I will admit I have a curiosity for corporate life. Enough
                    where I want to work in an office for a couple of years, use that money to fund everything else I
                    dreamed of doing as a kid. Probably won't have kids then if that is the case. Can't have kids if I
                    don't have a stable income or a stable roof. Regardless, here are the steps I have thought of for
                    becoming a pro-side quester like Shaq. </p>

                <h2>The Steps</h2>
                <p>1. Side Quest Mindset: Just like Shaq took on various roles beyond basketball, I need to be open to
                    exploring different opportunities and interests.</p>
                <p>2. Build a Strong Network: Connecting with like-minded individuals and mentors can provide guidance
                    and open doors to new adventures.</p>
                <p>3. Invest in Skills: Whether it's through formal education or self-directed learning, acquiring new
                    skills will be essential for my journey.</p>
                <p>4. Stay Adaptable: The ability to pivot and adapt to changing circumstances will be crucial as I
                    navigate my career and personal life.</p>
                <p>5. Prioritize Well-Being: Just as Shaq emphasizes the importance of mental and physical health, I
                    must prioritize my well-being throughout this journey.</p>

                <h2>Check-In</h2>
                <p> I don't think this is a linear process, but it is probably similar to the Agile Methodology we are
                    taught in Computer Science Classes. I would say I am on Sprint 2 or 3 in the last 3 or 4 years.</p>
                <p> I would say I am on Sprint 2 or 3 in the last 3 or 4 years. </p>
                <p> My most recent sprint really delved into side projects and caring for my mental health. This sprint
                    started last November when I started my efforts to find a therapist after 4 unsuccessful years of
                    previous attempts. Then BOOM, I met Monica, and she is really cool. She told me on our first
                    meeting, which was just supposed to be an intake, that I probably have ADHD, and she told me she
                    also has ADHD, and got diagnosed later as well. Turns out this is common because of the research
                    process that went into diagnosing ADHD. Their pool of subjects they were using was all young boys.
                    ADHD shows up differently in women and in Men, and so because of a systematic lack of focus on
                    women, gender stereotypes associated with being a girl, and the difference in maturity speeds in men
                    and women, women are more likely to be diagnosed later, usually in their early to mid twenties.</p>

                <p> Regardless, viewing life as a collection of side quests has really opened up my opportunity to live
                    life a bit more like a game, try not to take it seriously, and also taught me what stuff I need to
                    prioritize. My mental health and projects are my priority for this sprint; we will see what the next
                    sprint will be. </p>
